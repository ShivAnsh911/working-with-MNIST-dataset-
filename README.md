# working-with-MNIST-dataset-
This repository conatins easy example to work with MNIST database as a beginner in ML.
MNIST is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems containing 60,000 images
for training and 10,000 for testing. MNIST database is widely used in field of Machine Learning.

Thee repo conatins a simple model trained as a binary classifier to classify a digit as 5 or not 5 
using [SGDclassifier](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier.html) 
from scikit-learn library.
